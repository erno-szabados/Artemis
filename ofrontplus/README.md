Ofront+ - Not portable
======================

In this directory are Artemis modules for Ofront+. This is
currently a placeholder but will become populated as the
non-portable Artemis modules are completed.  The non-portable
modules use C code integration. It is a counter part
to the obnc and oxford directories. 

Modules naming
--------------

Where modules are not canonical to Artemis the modules names have
a prefix of "art" (e.g. Clock.Mod is named artClock.Mod). Where 
they are canonical to Artemis (e.g. Chars.Mod in the project root)
they do not have a prefix.
