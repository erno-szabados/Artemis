    CSPChannels.Mod - Thread-safe channels for CSP-style communication
    
    Provides:
    - Thread-safe buffered channels with blocking/non-blocking operations
    - Thread-safe synchronous channels for rendezvous communication
    - Clean CSP-style communication primitives
    
    This module implements two distinct channel types:
    
    BUFFERED CHANNELS:
    - Fixed-capacity buffer with FIFO semantics
    - Non-blocking operations (TrySend/TryReceive) for immediate checks
    - Blocking operations (Send/Receive) for guaranteed delivery
    - Graceful closure with buffer draining
    
    SYNCHRONOUS CHANNELS:
    - True CSP rendezvous semantics
    - Direct sender-to-receiver handoff with no buffering
    - Both parties must be ready simultaneously
    - Ideal for tightly coordinated communication patterns
    
    Both channel types are fully thread-safe and use efficient mutex/condition
    variable synchronization for optimal performance under contention.
