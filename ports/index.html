README Ports

<p>
The ports directory contains modules that were ported to a POSIX environment from previous Oberon Systems written in Oberon-2. The ported code is written in Oberon-7. Where necessary compatibility modules have been created to minimize the changes to the ported code.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="s3/">s3</a> contains ports from Native Oberon to Oberon-7
</li>
<li>
<a href="v4/">v4</a> contains ports of Linz V4 code to Oberon-7
</li>
</ul>

The basic data types in Oberon-7 are more limitted. In some cases the data types could simply be mapped to the newer version of the language. The built-in procedures and functions are different from Oberon-2 to Oberon-7. The <a href="Obn2.Mod">Obn2.Mod</a> provides a small collection of formerly build-in Oberon-2 function for use in Oberon-7.

POSIX compilers
</h2>
<p>
Artemis and these ports have been developed with two Oberon-7 POSIX based compilers in mind
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="">OBNC</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/Spivoxity/Obc-3" title="aka Oxford Oberon Compiler">Obc-3</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
OBNC advantage is it is realatively easy to port between POSIX systems. It only requires a good C compiler and perhaps SLD. Obc-3 has the advantage of also being able to compile both Oberon-2 and Oberon-7 code selectable with a command line flag. This has been used to help compare behaviors in the language.

Standard compiler envocation, <code>obnc MODULE_NAME</code>

Haven’t noticed deviation from Oakwood except Out has some additional output formats. Relying on these means you’re use of Out is not portable.

<p>
Standard compiler envocation, <code>obc -07 DEP_MODULE_LIST PROG_MODULE -m</code>
</p>
<p>
The latest version on GitHub includes more standard Oakwood style implementations of Out and Math modules.
